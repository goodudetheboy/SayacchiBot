# **SayacchiBot** #
A cool Discord bot I wrote in appreciation of my favorite WeatherNews Caster: Hiyama Saya, AKA Sayacchi!

---

### Full Command List ###
```
!saya
Get random image of Sayacchi from Google Images.
!timetable

!help
List all of my commands or info about a specific command.
!reload
Reloads a command (for testing use only)
```

### Installation ###
1. Install node
2. Run `npm install` in this project directory. This will take a while since I'm using puppeteer, which downloads the whole Chromium package
3. Run `npm start`

---

### Hosting ###
Currently I'm hosting on repl.it, which works fine for now, but if you want to use it, you will need to create a Bash project instead of a Node.js project to run this project.
I haven't explored other options yet.

### Bug Reporting ###
Raise an issue and I'll look into it ASAP, or maybe soon, idk I'm a busy man.
